The scripts in this directory rely on your files having sample names with .fa, .mo, .p1 in the name. 

* .fa = father
* .mo = mother
* .p1 = child

It also requires a families.txt file with one family name per line so for example if the family is named **AJfamily** and the samples are requisitely **AJfamily.fa,AJfamily.mo,AJfamily.p1** then the one line would be AJfamily.

It is recommended to add an `output` directory inside of the current directory.
